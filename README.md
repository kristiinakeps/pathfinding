# Different pathfinding algorithms
### Project for the course Algorithmics (MTAT.03.238)
Authors: Hanna Britt Parman, Kristiina Keps

In this project we try out two maze generation algorithms: Randomized Prim's algortihm and DFS with flooding. We then use different maze solvers to solve these paths like random mouse, wall follower, Pledge, Tr√©maux and recursive algorithm. We also implement shortest path algorithms Djikstra, A*, DFS and BFS.
