# Different pathfinding algorithms
### Project for the course Algorithmics (MTAT.03.238)
Authors: Hanna Britt Parman, Kristiina Keps

In this project we try out different pathfinding algorithms like Djikstra, A*, DFS. We generate random mazes using Randomized Prim's algorithm and compare the performance of the pathfinding algorithms in these mazes.
